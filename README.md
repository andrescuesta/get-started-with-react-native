## Instructor: [Markus Mühlberger][instructor url]


Mobile app users expect the performance and features that can only be supplied by native app development. But, going native often means that you have to develop your app for multiple platforms. React Native, created by Facebook, bridges this gap by letting you write your user interface in modern JavaScript and automatically transforming it into native platform-specific views.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Markus Mühlberger will give you an introduction to writing mobile applications in React Native. You will learn how to create, lay out and style components, provide user interaction, and integrate third-party components into your app. Along the way, you'll build a cool cross-platform mapping app!
